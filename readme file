TOKENS:-

This Solidity program is a simple "TOKEN" program to simply mint and burn tokens that demonstrate the use of variables functions parmeters and if statement

DESCRIPTION:-

The 'MyToken' contract is a simple implementation of a token on the Ethereum blockchain. It defines a token named "Token" with the abbreviation "Tok" and provides basic functionalities to mint and burn tokens using mint function and burn function.
also we are using error handeling statements listed below:
1. Assert :The assert() statement is used to check for conditions that should never fail. 
2. Revert: The revert() statement explicitly aborts a transaction and provides an error message.
3.require: The require() statement is used to ensure that certain conditions are met before executing the code.

EXECUTING PROGRAM:-

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.
